Bounce.sketchplugin
===================

This bouncy balls animation for [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) sprinkles dots of random sizes and hues around your artboard using a ‘multiply’ blending mode, then bounces them off the artboard edges for 200 frames. If Sketch crashes try increasing the amount of time per frame—which is set in the `scheduleWithRepeatingInterval_jsFunction()` function.

Sketch plugins are written in CocoaScript which is basically JavaScript with access to Cocoa frameworks and a splash of that sassy Objective C bracket syntax.
